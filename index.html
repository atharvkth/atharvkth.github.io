                <h2>on losing neuroplasticity, and what that means for my music-listening habits</h2>
                <p class="timestamp"></p>
                <p>PS: read <a href="https://atharvkth.github.io/before-you-read.html">#2</a> for the em dash explanation.</p>
                <br>
                <p>as i creep toward neurorigidity â€” that point where my brain calcifies and new music stops hitting the same â€” the frequency of discovering songs i love is bound to drop. but not today. today, i'm twenty-one, and every good track i stumble on gets a memory bolted to it, sharp and distinct, because life keeps throwing curveballs every week.</p>
                <br>
                <p>it's a shame, though. these songs find me now, when i'm helplessly lovesick, venturing dangerously close to Mosby-isms. i know it's a long shotâ€”okay, a non-starterâ€”that anything'll come of it. and if every lyric keeps stirring that ache, i'm screwed. once i shelve this mess, these'll just turn into tracks i skip without second thought â€” when they eventually sneak onto shuffle.</p>
                <br>
                <p>but that's still far out. today, <a href="https://open.spotify.com/playlist/7CyTa3cuT3OMOTJRwCUNA7?si=d49d5ef27ce94d4a">this playlist</a> kicks off summer 2025, a random Monday worth marking. while my brain's still "plastic" enough to soak it in, i'll let these songs burn their grooves deep â€” before the rigidity locks me into whatever i've already got spinning.</p>
