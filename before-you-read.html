                <h2>Q: what is this site?</h2>
                <p>A: i suddenly have a lot of half-baked thoughts about my twenties. putting them out on a blog is very 2000s coded, and sounds super cool.</p>

                <h2>Q: what's with the em dashes?</h2>
                <p>A: okay â€“ i've been an em dash truther since before it was attributed to AI-generated writing, alright? excessive em dashes help me get my point(s) across better.</p>

            <div class="qa">
                <h2>Q: you said X, why're you reverting to Y now?</h2>
                <p>A: like i said â€“ half-baked. i can be deeply self-contradicting at times.</p>

                <h2>Q: you said auto-capitalization was in for 2025. what happened?</h2>
                <p>A: i can't do it anymore â€“ it's too ugly ðŸ˜­</p>
                <p>i'll still probably use it on Email/Slack or whatever, but that's the extent of it.</p>

                <h2>Q: what's with the website's design?</h2>
                <p>A: i've autobotted the entire `style.css` part. can you tell web design is my passion? suggestions are definitely welcome, though.</p>
